# MLOps Solution for Network Security in Malicious URL Detection

This is a comprehensive, end-to-end MLOps solution designed to detect and classify malicious URLs, ensuring user safety by identifying harmful links through machine learning. The solution integrates data ingestion, model training, deployment, and continuous monitoring, delivering both real-time and batch URL safety assessments, providing an automated, scalable approach to web security.

## Introduction

Malicious URLs are commonly used by cybercriminals in phishing attacks, social engineering schemes, and malware attacks, posing significant risks to individuals and organizations. The Malicious URL Detection project uses machine learning to identify and classify these harmful links, enabling timely interventions and improved web security. This solution includes a robust pipeline for detecting malicious URLs, offering both real-time single URL predictions and batch predictions through an interactive user interface.

## Components

### 1. Frontend (Streamlit)
There is a live demo of this project using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) which you can find [here](https://network-security-system-mlops-6nshvkcv8cxrngosbdlrhb.streamlit.app/). The Streamlit app provides an intuitive interface for users to predict single URLs as Malicious, Suspicious or Safe:


- Safe URL Example:
![Streamlit Safe URL](_assets/streamlit_safe.png)

- Suspicious URL Example:
![Streamlit Suspicious URL](_assets/streamlit_suspicious.png)

- Malicious URL Example:
![Streamlit Malicious URL](_assets/streamlit_malicious.png)

### 2. Backend (FastAPI)
FastAPI handles the model's operational tasks, including triggering model training and supporting batch predictions:

 - Training Route: Exposes an endpoint that can be triggered to initiate the model training process. This can be invoked via FastAPI or automated through Airflow.

 - Batch Prediction Route: Allows users to upload CSV files containing multiple URLs for batch predictions. The system processes the file and returns the prediction results.

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Validated the schema to ensure all required columns are present.
   - Checked numerical columns for correctness and detected **data drift** using statistical tests.
   - Generated detailed drift reports to monitor dataset consistency.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Applied preprocessing steps, such as imputing missing values using a **KNNImputer**.
   - Prepared the data into transformed **NumPy arrays** for model training.
   - Saved the transformation pipeline as an artifact for future use.
   - Saved the preprocessing pipeline as a **pickle file**.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Implemented a range of classification models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and AdaBoost.
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV** with predefined parameter grids for each model to enhance performance.
   - Trained and tested models on transformed datasets to ensure consistent preprocessing.
   - Compared the performance of different models using multiple evaluation metrics to ensure the most suitable model was selected for the task.
   - Saved the final trained model as a **pickle file**.
   - Evaluated metrics such as **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score** for the model through multiple experiments, with results tracked using **MLflow**, which is hosted on **AWS**. 
    ![MLflow Experiments](_assets/mlflow_experiments.png)
    ![MLflow Artifacts](_assets/mlflow_artifacts.png)
   - MLflow experiments, models, and other artifacts are stored in a bucket named "mlflowtrackingnetwork" in an S3 bucket.
